# CONFIG FILE
# This file lets you adjust several parameters for map generation, some have to be adjusted while others are optional.
# When changing values, make sure to stay in line with the original formatting, otherwise things might not work.
# A guide can be found here: https://github.com/Til-Weimann/EnhancedMapsTool/blob/main/README.md


# PATHS
# Paths you need to set for the script to work.

# gdaldem is a program shipped with QGIS, it is required for the script to work. If you have QGIS, your path is likely similar, though you'll probably have to at least adjust the version number.
gdaldem-path: 'C:\Program Files\QGIS 3.30.2\bin\gdaldem.exe'


# TERRAIN INFO
# You can look these up under Info & Diags in the Terrain Tools tab.

# The info tab refers to cell size as planar resolution.
cell-size: 2.0
# Minimum height supported by your terrain.
height-range-min: -204.781
# Maximum height supported by your terrain.
height-range-max: 1843.188
# If your terrain entity is not located in the world origin (it should be), specify its coordinates.
terrain-coords: '0 0 0'


# CUSTOMIZATION
# Some parameters to adjust the final look of the map.
# These are optional modifiers, changing them is not required as the algorithm already takes many things into account.

# How exaggerated the relief appears on the map. I advise leaving this at 1.0 for consistency across all terrains.
relief-strength: 1.0

# What color the ocean has.
ocean-color: '64 192 192'
# Adjust how dark (or deep) the ocean appears.
ocean-darkness: 1.0
# How clearly the relief is visible through the ocean. There is a tradeoff with color.
ocean-relief-strength: 1.0

# Vegetation color: Deciduous tree
veg-color-deci: '50 140 20 200'
# Vegetation color: Coniferous tree
veg-color-coni: '10 120 10 200'
# Vegetation color: Dead tree
veg-color-dead: '40 35 30 175'
# Vegetation color: Bush
veg-color-bush: '50 150 20 120'
# Vegetation color: Reed
veg-color-reed: '70 160 0 150'

# Multiplier for global vegetation blur - increasing this will e. g. result in less distinct forests.
veg-blur-size: 1.00
